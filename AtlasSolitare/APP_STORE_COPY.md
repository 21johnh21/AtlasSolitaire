EXPLORE THE WORLD THROUGH SOLITAIRE

Atlas Solitaire combines the classic card game you love with an educational journey around the globe. Instead of matching traditional suits, you'll group cards by countries, continents, and geographic regions—turning every game into a world tour!

WHAT MAKES ATLAS SOLITAIRE UNIQUE?

• Geography-Based Gameplay: Match cards representing countries, continents, cities, and regions. From Asian nations to European capitals, every deck teaches you about our world.

• Rotating Global Themes: Each game features different geographic groups—continents one round, countries the next, regions after that. Explore new parts of the world with every deal!

• Learn While You Play: Reinforce your geography knowledge naturally. Perfect for students, travelers, and anyone curious about the world.

• Familiar Solitaire Rules: If you know Klondike, you're ready to play. Classic gameplay with a worldly twist.

• Beautiful, Clean Design: Enjoy a gorgeous felt table, smooth animations, and card designs that showcase global diversity.

HOW TO PLAY

Atlas Solitaire follows classic solitaire (Klondike) rules with a geographic twist. Instead of organizing cards by hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, you'll match cards from the same geographic group.

For example, one game might feature:
• Group 1: Asian Countries (Japan, China, India, Thailand...)
• Group 2: European Countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain...)
• Group 3: African Countries (Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria...)
• Group 4: American Countries (USA, Mexico, Brazil, Canada...)

The goal remains the same—build foundation piles from Ace to King—but now you're organizing the world, not just suits!

• Draw cards from the stock pile
• Build sequences in the tableau
• Complete foundations by matching geographic groups
• Celebrate as you "complete" each region
• Discover new geographic themes each game

## 💡 USAGE TIPS

### Promotional Text Best Practices:
- Update seasonally to keep listing fresh
- Test different angles (gameplay, competition, relaxation)
- Change it when you add new features
- A/B test if you have multiple regions

### Description Best Practices:
- Front-load important info (first 3 lines visible before "more")
- Use keywords naturally (helps ASO but don't stuff)
- Break into scannable sections
- Include clear calls-to-action
- Mention free/no ads upfront if applicable

### Keyword Best Practices:
- Don't repeat words (Apple indexes each word once)
- Use singular form (Apple matches plurals automatically)
- Avoid spaces after commas (wastes characters)
- Research competitor keywords in App Store
- Update based on search term performance

---

## 📈 ASO (App Store Optimization) STRATEGY

### Primary Keywords (High Priority):
1. **solitaire** (extremely high volume - traditional market)
2. **geography** (UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR - untapped niche!)
3. **card game** (high volume, competitive)
4. **educational** (opens entire edu market)

### Secondary Keywords (Medium Priority):
5. **atlas** (double meaning: brand + geography)
6. **countries** (specific content descriptor)
7. **world** (geographic scope)
8. **klondike** (solitaire variant)
9. **puzzle** (category crossover)

### Long-Tail Keywords (Lower Priority but Valuable):
10. **learn** (educational intent, shorter than "learning")

### STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:
You're in a **BLUE OCEAN** - there are NO major geography-based solitaire games! You'll capture:
- Solitaire players looking for something new
- Geography students/teachers
- Educational game market
- Travel enthusiasts
- Parents wanting educational screen time

### Keywords in App Name/Subtitle:
Your app name "Atlas Solitaire" perfectly captures both keywords:
- **"Atlas"** = Geography/World/Educational
- **"Solitaire"** = Primary game category

Subtitle "World Geography Card Game" adds:
- **"World"** = Geographic scope
- **"Geography"** = Educational differentiator
- **"Card Game"** = Clear category

### Localization Opportunities:
If you localize to other languages later:
- Spanish: "solitario, geografía, países, mundo"
- French: "solitaire, géographie, pays, monde"
- German: "solitär, geographie, länder, welt"
- Italian: "solitario, geografia, paesi, mondo"
- Portuguese: "paciência, geografia, países" (huge market in Brazil!)
